    "# An Introduction to LlamaIndex Query Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "LlamaIndex provides a declarative query API that allows you to chain together different modules in order to orchestrate simple-to-advanced workflows over your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is centered around our `QueryPipeline` abstraction. Load in a variety of modules (from LLMs to prompts to retrievers to other pipelines), connect them all together into a sequential chain or DAG, and run it end2end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: You can orchestrate all these workflows without the declarative pipeline abstraction (by using the modules imperatively and writing your own functions). So what are the advantages of `QueryPipeline`? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Express common workflows with fewer lines of code/boilerplate\n",
    "- Greater readability\n",
    "- Greater parity / better integration points with common low-code / no-code solutions (e.g. LangFlow)\n",
    "- [In the future] A declarative interface allows easy serializability of pipeline components, providing portability of pipelines/easier deployment to different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cookbook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook we give you an introduction to our `QueryPipeline` interface and show you some basic workflows you can tackle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chain together prompt and LLM\n",
    "- Chain together query rewriting (prompt + LLM) with retrieval\n",
    "- Chain together a full RAG query pipeline (query rewriting, retrieval, reranking, response synthesis)\n",
    "- Setting up a custom query component"

      "Paul Graham played a significant role in the founding and development of Y Combinator (YC). He was one of the co-founders of YC and was actively involved in its early stages. He helped establish the Summer Founders Program (SFP) and was responsible for selecting and funding the initial batch of startups. Graham also played a key role in shaping the funding model for YC, based on previous deals and agreements. As YC grew, Graham's involvement expanded, and he dedicated a significant amount of his time and attention to the organization. However, in later years, he decided to step back from his role and hand over the leadership to Sam Altman.\n"
